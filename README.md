# Java2HTMLReports
This is my attempt at an easy to use Java class that will genterate basic, but useful, HTML reports 

I have repeatedly been frustrated by changes in some products dependencies or base code that ruin a project that I am working on. Right about the time I master a java related product or add on, and complete a project, the add on changes somehow. Or worse it changes dependencies, or its dependencies change. As an example, a few times when I finish a huge project using bootstrap, for example, either bootstrap changes, the web browsers webkit changes or some other dependency that I didn’t know was involved. The frustration gets worse when I can’t figure out what changed or what I need to do to fix it. This is the main drive behind this Java Class to produce HTML report pages. 

The main goals are to have no dependencies on other products, HTML based output, easy to edit class, when things change and easy to use.

Requirements:
No dependencies on commercial products

Clear documentation and instructions

Base default settings 

Most formatting from CSS

Store settings outside of app, DB or file

Support various export formats: xml, DOC, ODT, XLS, DOCX, XLSX, HTML

Enable various methods of data fetching such as XSL, SQL, JPQL or Groovy script
